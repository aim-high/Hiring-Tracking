# Hiring-Tracking
Hiring team will use to track hiring in different regions/sites to better inform recruitment efforts


Each Site would have a table like this:

| Hired Staff			|Not Hired Apps |Apps Needed	 |
| :-----------: |:-------------:| :-------------: |
| 6th	        | 25		    | 	12	 		 |
| 7th	        | 15	      |   5			   |
| 8th		    | 10	        |   7	 		   |
| 9th		    | 10	        |   8	 		   |

**Purpose:** Create script to automate the daily searching tasks that hiring team needs to make recruiting
decisions during application season.
